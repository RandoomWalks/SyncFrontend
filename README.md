# IndexedDB with Web Worker Demo

## Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates a client-side application architecture that combines IndexedDB for local storage, Web Workers for background processing, and a synchronization mechanism with a server. The architecture is designed to provide a responsive user interface while handling data operations and synchronization in the background.

### Key Components

1. **Main Application (main.js)**
   - Handles user interface interactions
   - Communicates with the Web Worker
   - Manages server synchronization

2. **Web Worker (worker.js)**
   - Performs IndexedDB operations
   - Handles data processing in the background

3. **View Utilities (view.js)**
   - Contains functions for updating the UI

4. **IndexedDB**
   - Stores local data

5. **Server API**
   - Handles synchronization of changes

## Data Flow

1. User interactions trigger events in `main.js`.
2. `main.js` sends messages to the Web Worker for data operations.
3. The Web Worker performs operations on IndexedDB and sends results back to `main.js`.
4. `main.js` updates the UI using functions from `view.js`.
5. Periodically, `main.js` syncs changes with the server.

## Synchronization Mechanism

- Client changes are sent to the server
- Server changes are fetched and applied locally
- Conflict resolution is handled on the server side

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `main.js`: Main application logic
- `worker.js`: Web Worker for background processing
- `view.js`: UI update utilities
- `styles.css`: Styling for the application

## Key Features

- Offline-first architecture using IndexedDB
- Background processing with Web Workers
- Real-time synchronization with server
- Separation of concerns (UI, data processing, view updates)

## Setup and Running

[Include instructions for setting up and running the project]

## Testing

[Include information about the Cypress tests and how to run them]

## Future Improvements

- Implement more robust error handling
- Enhance the synchronization algorithm
- Add more complex operations and UI features
